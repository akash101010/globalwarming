        <h2><em>Carbon Dioxide (CO2)</em></h2>
        <p><em>Carbon dioxide is the most prevalent greenhouse gas emitted by human activities. It is released through the burning of fossil fuels (like coal, oil, and natural gas), deforestation, and various industrial processes. High levels of CO2 in the atmosphere are a major contributor to global warming.</em></p>
        <h2><em>Methane (CH4)</em></h2>
        <p><em>Methane is another potent greenhouse gas. It is released during the production and transport of coal, oil, and natural gas. It is also emitted by livestock (enteric fermentation in the digestive systems of cattle), wetlands, and the decay of organic waste in landfills. Though there is less methane in the atmosphere compared to CO2, it is much more effective at trapping heat.</em></p>
        <h2><em>Nitrous Oxide (N2O)</em></h2>
        <p><em>Nitrous oxide is released from agricultural and industrial activities, as well as the combustion of fossil fuels and biomass. It is also produced by natural processes in soil and water.</em></p>
        <h2><em>Water Vapor (H2O)</em></h2>
        <p><em>Water vapor is the most abundant greenhouse gas in the atmosphere, but its concentration is largely controlled by temperature and natural processes rather than human activities. It acts as a feedback mechanism in the climate system, intensifying the effects of other greenhouse gases.</em></p>
        <h2><em>Ozone (O3)</em></h2>
        <p><em>While ozone in the stratosphere (the ozone layer) is beneficial as it absorbs harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation, ground-level ozone is a greenhouse gas and a pollutant. It is formed by chemical reactions between volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides in the presence of sunlight.</em></p>
        <h2><em>Other Greenhouse Gases</em></h2>
        <p><em>Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) are synthetic compounds with high global warming potentials.</em></p>

        <h3><em>Greenhouse Gas Emissions</em></h3>
        <p><em>Human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, industrial processes, and agriculture, release significant amounts of greenhouse gases (GHGs) like carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and fluorinated gases into the atmosphere.</em></p>
        <h3><em>Deforestation</em></h3>
        <p><em>Trees and forests act as carbon sinks, absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere during photosynthesis. Deforestation reduces the number of trees available to absorb CO2, leading to higher concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere and contributing to global warming.</em></p>
        <h3><em>Industrial and Agricultural Activities</em></h3>
        <p><em>Various industrial processes, such as manufacturing, mining, and cement production, release GHGs and other pollutants into the atmosphere. Additionally, agricultural practices, including livestock farming and rice cultivation, contribute to GHG
